# SQL Data Analysis Practice

This repository demonstrates practical SQL skills used in day-to-day data analysis.
It focuses on querying, aggregating, and joining data to answer common business
questions using a simple retail sales dataset.

The project is designed to reflect realistic analyst workflows rather than
advanced database engineering.

---

## Dataset

The analysis uses two CSV files:

- **retail_sales.csv**  
  Contains order-level sales data including product, category, region, quantity,
  unit price, and order date.

- **customers.csv**  
  Contains basic customer information, including customer name and segment.

The datasets are intentionally small but structured to support meaningful SQL
analysis, including joins and aggregations.
